## Hand Over Document (How to setup)
1. First git pull the project repo to your local computer
2. Install expo to your computer if you havent already with "npm install --global expo-cli"
3. As the package.json file already contains the dependencies run "yarn install" to download all the required node module files
4. I would need to hand over the environment variables file which contains sensitive info such as my database api keys.
5. To run, simply type "npm run web" or "expo start" which will open the expo CLI.
6. The app is pretty self explanatory, if you do not have an account you can signup and then gain access to all the app's features.
